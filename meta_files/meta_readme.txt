The validation/test sets have gone through a more careful quality check. 
for validation/test splits, plans are D05_div_D95 < 1.07 and max_div_D95 < 1.12. However, the number of D05_div_D95 and max_div_D95 is not disclosured to participants. 
D05_div_D95 = D05 / D95 of the PTV high. 
max_div_D95 = max(D) / D95 of the PTV high.
